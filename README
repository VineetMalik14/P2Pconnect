# P2Pconnect

This project designs and implements a peer-to-peer real-time
video call application with an integrated text chat feature
using WebRTC protocol and Firebase as the signaling server.
The application is hosted on Cloud. Users have the capability
to conduct video calls while simultaneously engaging in realtime text-based conversations through a dedicated chat panel.
A new bitrate control algorithm is incorporated and the
performance is evaluated under various network conditions.

To get started with this project, follow these steps:
